description: Slides of my talk about full-text search in PostgreSQL

Last night I gave a talk about full-text search in PostgreSQL.

Here are the slides, which are not of much use by themselves but you can check
out the speaker notes which I puffed up a bit just now.

*Update 2016-04-27: Slides updated following my talk last night at the
PostgreSQL User Group in Nantes*

If you have any questions or remarks or insults you can hit me up in the
comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/urcadox">twitter</a>.

I sincerely hope I will do another one soon, it was actually really fun to do!
I just have to find a subject now. :-)

By the way, <a href="http://speaking.io">this</a> has been a big help for me,
you should definitely check it out, it cannot hurt.
